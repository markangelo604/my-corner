> ⚠️ **Heads up** — this is not a portfolio, CV, or resume. No professional achievements, no skill bars, no "I'm passionate about synergy." This is just my personal site built for fun — a place to dump things I like, games I play, and whatever else I feel like putting on the internet. It's a hobby project and a work in progress, probably forever. Manage expectations accordingly. 🎮
